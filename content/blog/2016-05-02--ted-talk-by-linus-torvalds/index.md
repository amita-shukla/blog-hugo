Was just browsing some videos on the Ted website that I came across the interview of Linus Torvlads. It is so interesting to have a peek into the lives of people who change the world. How he lead to transform lives of people, with softwares he made but did not went on to commercialize them. 
 
And yes, the Linux World Headquarters view is quite amusing! :D
