__Hi 👋 I'm Amita__, a __Software Developer__ with 9 years of experience based in India. A programmer at heart, I love building, learning and breaking stuff using code 😬. A screen of clean code gives me the same feeling as opening a page from a fresh book...

My expertise lies in building __Backend, Big Data and Cloud-based applications__, though I also take on database, frontend, machine learning work from time to time.

## Tech Stack
My father brought home a desktop when I was 10, back then it was just a sophisticated toy for me. I have come a long way since then, from using applications to writing them.

A chunk of my experience has gone into writing __REST web services__, engines and frameworks using __Java/Spring__, batch and streaming data transformations using __Scala/Spark/Kafka/Hive/MapReduce__, Natural Language Processing using Python/R, and SQL/Python/Shell Scripting.

On the frontend side, I have worked with React and vanilla Javascript, and a little bit with Purescript. This blog I maintain is mainly built on React, Gatsbyjs and GraphQL.

I believe in not restricting myself to the tech stack or programming language but rather focus on the purpose it solves, having switched gears between Python, Haskell, Groovy, .Net/ C#, PHP, C++ in the past. Overtime, I have gotten more inclined towards __type safe languages__.
