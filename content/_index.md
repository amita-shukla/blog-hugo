__Hi 👋 I'm Amita__, a Software Developer with around 9 years of experience based in India. A programmer at heart, I love building, learning and breaking stuff using code 😬. A screen of clean code gives me the same feeling as opening a page from a fresh book...

My expertise lies in building __Backend, Big Data and Cloud-based applications__, though I also take on database, frontend, machine learning work from time to time.

## Tech Stack
My father brought home a desktop when I was 10, back then it was just a sophisticated toy for me. I have come a long way since then, from using applications to writing them.

A chunk of my experience has gone into writing REST web services, engines and frameworks using Java/Spring, batch and streaming data transformations using Scala/Spark/Kafka/Hive/MapReduce, Natural Language Processing using Python/R, and SQL/Python/Shell Scripting.

On the frontend side, I have worked with React and vanilla Javascript, and a little bit with Purescript. 

I believe in not restricting myself to the tech stack or programming language but rather focus on the purpose it solves, having switched gears between Python, Haskell, Groovy, .Net/ C#, PHP, C++ in the past. Overtime, I have gotten more inclined towards __type safe languages__.

## More about this Blog
This blog is now built using Hugo and a minimal, content-first setup, something I deliberately chose to keep the focus on writing rather than tooling.

Dive into my thoughts [here](/blog). I combine my passion for programming, teaching and writing through long-form posts and short notes.  
This blog is **open source** and lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/amita-shukla/blog-hugo). If you spot an issue or want to suggest an improvement, feel free to open an issue or fork it and make it your own.
